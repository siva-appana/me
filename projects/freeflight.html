<h1>Free flight design specifications and performance</h1>

<i>Man must rise above the Earth—to the top of the atmosphere and beyond—for only thus will he fully understand the world in which he lives.</i><br>

    Planes soaring gracefully through the sky have astonished me for as long as I can remember. Imagine the quantity of data that can be determined about the human condition from such an altitude.
    Eventually, I was made aware about indoor free-flight competitions by my high school engineering teacher, Mr. Travis Hodges. To compete, competitors construct 
    balsa-based rubber-band powered planes that sustain flight for extended periods of time. Depending on the competition, limitations are placed on the plane's mass,
    rubber's mass, fuselage's length, and wingspan.

    The video below shows my first plane at my first free flight competition with the Technology Student Association. In this competition, the plane must weigh a minimum 
    of 8 grams, fit in a 35cm x 40cm x 25cm box, and consist of rubber weighing less than 8 grams. Additionally, the judges award a bonus for taking off from the ground
    and landing on the ground with the landing gear.

    Between 2018 and 2021, I accummulated several awards in free flight competitions conducted by organizations such as the Technology Student Association (TSA) and Science Olympiad. The
    documentation below is my final competition plane's memory before COVID-19 consumed people's thoughts.

    Over the years, I learned several tips and techniques for constructing and flying a plane. Techniques range from using flow simulations on SolidWorks to perfecting
    the airfoil's shape during construction to treating the rubber with lubricants to slow the loading rate. My final recorded flight before COVID-19 is
    embedded below. Unfortunately, several conditions, including but not limited to the ambient temperature, downward drafts from vents, and damages to the plane during
    transportation, limited the plane's peak flight time. However, the highest recorded flight time was 2:42 (minutes:seconds).
