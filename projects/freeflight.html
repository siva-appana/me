				Planes soaring gracefully through the sky have astonished me for as long as I can remember. Eventually, I was made aware about indoor free-flight competitions 
				by my high school engineering teacher, Mr. Travis Hodges. To compete, competitors construct balsa-based rubber-band powered planes that sustain flight for 
				extended periods of time. Depending on the competition, limitations are placed on the plane's mass, rubber's mass, fuselage's length, and wingspan.

				The video above shows my first plane at my first free flight competition with the Technology Student Association. In this competition, the plane must weigh a minimum 
				of 8 grams, fit in a 35cm x 40cm x 25cm box, and consist of rubber weighing less than 8 grams. Additionally, the judges award a bonus for taking off from the ground
				and landing on the ground with the landing gear.

				Between 2018 and 2021, I accumulated several awards in free flight competitions conducted by organizations such as the Technology Student Association (TSA) and Science Olympiad. The
				documentation above is my final competition plane's memory before COVID-19 consumed people's thoughts.

				Over the years, I learned several tips and techniques for constructing and flying a plane. Techniques range from using flow simulations on SolidWorks to perfecting
				the airfoil's shape during construction to treating the rubber with lubricants to slow the loading rate. My final recorded flight before COVID-19 is
				shown above. Unfortunately, several conditions, including but not limited to the ambient temperature, downward drafts from vents, and damages to the plane during
				transportation, limited the plane's peak flight time. However, the highest recorded free flight time was 2:42 (minutes:seconds).

				Unable to stop building planes, I had begun constructing smaller planes designed to fly in my small bedroom. The primary challenge was to generate the necessary
				centripetal force to minimize its path's radius. Ultimately, I was able to construct this 3.5-gram plane with a custom-designed propeller during quarantine.
