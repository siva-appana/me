<h1>ME 2110 robot competition</h1>

<p>
    The ME 2110 robot competition is the class's final project where students are tasked with completing tasks within a forty-second time period to maximize the
    points scored. I worked with V. Claussen, D. Mallot, and J. Perlmutter when completing this project. During my class's competition, there were approximately
    30 teams (120 students). To score the maximum points, we must deposit four table tennis balls in the rotating van's sunroof on the top of the centerpiece,
    insert a ball in each color of the centerpiece except the team's own, and exit the start region and contact nothing but the floor. We programmed the Arduino
    with excellent memory usage to prevent possible collisions between actions and built a reliable/calculated system using the mechatronics components provided
    to ensure maximum points are scored during each run.

    The details of this competition and our design considerations are detailed in the document below. Several images are shown of our design during each stage:
    brainstorming, sketch, CAD, and post-fabrication.

    During the final competition, we presented our design effectively in 10 minutes to several judges who tested us on design principles. The judges panel consisted
    of executives from Atlanta companies, distinguished mechanical engineering professors, and PhD students at Georgia Tech. Then, we competed in the competition where
    we scored the maximum points during each trial. In the end, we were declared the Design Champion and Competition Champion, winning 1st place in both awards.
