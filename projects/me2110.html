				The ME 2110 robot competition is the class's final project where students are tasked with completing tasks within a forty-second time period to maximize the
				points scored. I worked with V. Claussen, D. Mallot, and J. Perlmutter when completing this project. During my class's competition, there were approximately
				30 teams (120 students). To score the maximum points, we must deposit four table tennis balls in the rotating van's sunroof on the top of the centerpiece,
				insert a ball in each color of the centerpiece except the team's own, and exit the start region and contact nothing but the floor.

				We programmed the Arduino with excellent memory usage to prevent possible collisions between actions and built a reliable/calculated system using the mechatronics components provided
				to ensure maximum points are scored during each run.

				During the final competition, we presented our design effectively in 10 minutes to several judges who tested us on design principles. The judges panel consisted
				of executives from Atlanta companies, distinguished mechanical engineering professors, and PhD students at Georgia Tech. Then, we competed in the competition where
				we scored the maximum points during each trial. In the end, we were declared the Design Champion and Competition Champion, winning 1st place in both awards.
