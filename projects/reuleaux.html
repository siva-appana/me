<h1>Balancing a Reuleaux Triangular Prism on an Unstable Edge</h1>

<i>We live in a rainbow of chaos.</i><br>

<p>
    While taking ME 4012: <i>Modeling and Control of Motion Systems</i>, I worked with Mesum, Martha, and Mannan to mathematically model
    and balance a Reuleax triangular prism on an inherently unstable edge. The system contained a prismatic body with nominal depth and a 
    reaction wheel powered by a DC motor. The <a href="https://www.hobbywingdirect.com/products/xerun-4268-motor-g3">DC inrunner motor</a>, 
    acquired from a combat robot, was powered by a 6s Lipo battery. During testing, the motor's RPM capability posed a significant controls challenge due
    to dead spots present at low current inputs and low RPMs.
    <br><br>
    An IMU measured the body's angle about it's vertex. The Teensy corrected the angle's error with respect to the vertical axis (parallel to 
    gravity) by sending an output PWM to the motor. In turn, the reaction wheel rotates to apply a torque opposing the body's rotation. several 
    mechanical challenges were solved by leveraging 3-D printing. For instance, the friction between the ground and triangle's frame was 
    initially insufficient, so a fuzzy-skin attachment to the vertex prevented slippage. Finally, a variety of PI, PD, PID, loop-shaping, and 
    state-space controllers were modeled and tuned on System Controller Designer on MATLAB. After modeling and experimenting, a promising set of 
    PID parameters became apparent, as shown in the video below.
