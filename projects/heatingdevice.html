<h1>Cost-effective multifunctional solar heating device</h1>

<i>Number 7: Affordable and Clean Energy</i><br>

<span style="float:right">&ndash;United Nations, &quot;Sustainable Development Goals,&quot; 2016</span><br><br>

<p>
    Inspired by the United Nation's sustainable development goals, my team and I collaborated to create a physically accurate and feasible solution for harvesting
    energy in equatorial regions. The amount of energy utilized varies depending on the community's ability to afford various attachments.

    The solution utilizes common fabrication materials in liaison with a perfectly but cheaply tensioned catenary curve to reflect concentrated light to particular
    locations above the tool to heat attachments. Attachments include a kettle for boiling water to eliminate bad bacteria, a drying rack for drying dishes, and
    a stirling engine for power generation. Other add-ons include storage cabinets situated below the reflector. This innovation is detailed in the document below.
    Additionally, a supplemental fully-functional CAD model was designed and animated using SolidWorks.
